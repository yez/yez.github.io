<p>It is hard to believe that already nine months have passed since the onset of my <a href="http://jakeyesbeck.com/2015/04/23/a-year-of-commits/">Year of Commits</a>. In these past nine months, I have experienced a wide range of new aspects of open source development. This has truly been an eye opening experience, with many facets I doubt I would have experienced otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="confidence">Confidence</h2>

<p>An unexpected and fortuitous side effect of my Year of Commits has manifested as a significant boost in my overall coding confidence. Confidence is a very important aspect of anyone’s life. Without confidence, a person may place objectives out of reach or deem them too arduous to achieve. Believing in one’s self and having the confidence to stand up when knocked down is a trait that carries a lot of weight, especially when writing software.</p>

<p>Writing software can be a very subjective endeavor. Especially in languages like Ruby, there are many solutions to the same problem. These subtle differences can spark myriad conversations or criticisms of a person’s code. For those fortunate enough to write code for a living, think back to the times a pull request saw the most attention and accrued the most comments. Chances are, those comments pointed out style choice discrepancies or “we do not do it that way” assertions.</p>

<p>Maintaining a steady level of confidence in the midst of such feedback is paramount. I am lucky enough to have received feedback from many different people in many different situations. This feedback and perspective help inoculate a developer and encourage them to remember <a href="http://jakeyesbeck.com/2015/06/14/you-are-not-your-code/">they are not their code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="github-issues">Github Issues</h2>

<p>Another exciting event since my last <a href="http://jakeyesbeck.com/2015/11/01/six-months-of-commits/">year of commits update</a> pertains to Github issues. Github is a fantastic piece of software responsible for managing git repositories and enabling collaboration amongst developers. An issue may be opened by anyone with a Github account on any public repository of their choosing. These issues have been the primary avenue I have used to find which projects need help and what I can do to help them.</p>

<p>My excitement stems from the fact that, for the first time since I started Year of Commits, other developers have engaged with one of my projects (<a href="https://github.com/yez/passages">passages</a>) and submitted some issues! Having consumers of software one builds is a great feeling. An even greater feeling is when those people care enough to submit issues they think can better the project.</p>

<p>Becoming part of the open source community was a goal of this endeavor and I am thrilled to have taken my first few steps towards accomplishing that goal.</p>

<h2 id="code-discovery">Code Discovery</h2>

<p>Practice makes perfect. When reading code you did not write, knowing where to start and identifying patterns in code organization helps a great deal. Since the goal of Year of Commits was to contribute to my own <strong>and</strong> other people’s code, I have been reading <em>a lot</em> of code that I did not write. This has been a fantastic learning experience for me. At a typical software engineering job, coworkers’ code starts to blend styles and eventually become fairly homogeneous.</p>

<p>By reading code written by many different people, new patterns and styles add a level of depth to code grokking that is hard to replicate in other ways. I came to appreciate this accidentally discovered benefit of Year of Commits so much, <a href="http://jakeyesbeck.com/2015/10/25/how-to-traverse-foreign-ruby-code/">I wrote a whole post describing the process for foreign code traversal.</a></p>

<h2 id="the-home-stretch">The Home Stretch</h2>

<p>Year of Commits ends in April of 2016. Between now and then, I hope to learn even more about the open source software ecosystem and community. This project has had an incredibly positive affect on my life and I would prescribe something similar to anyone interested. My only goal between now and April is to have made a real contribution to a high visibility project.</p>

<p>The positive feedback I have received about this blog and the work that I have been doing helps make this easy. I would like to say thank you again to everyone on this journey with me.</p>
